		<header class="advertising-2"><h1>The 3D Painting class would be opened soon in our club</h1></header>
		<h1>What is 3D painting?</h1>
		<img src="../Images/3Dpaint.jpg" class="3Dpaint">
		<p>First of all, it is important to make a clear distinction between actual 3D painting, and other types of similar disciplines. While hyperrealistic and photorealistic art aims at depicting something that looks as close as possible to reality, 3D painting plays with perspectives. Often enough, 3D painting happens to also be painted in a very realistic way, but that is not the main point.</p>
		<p>The main characteristic of 3D painting (also called anamorphic painting) is a distorted projection. Indeed, it requires the viewer to look from a specific vantage point to reconstitute the image. When looking from somewhere else, the viewer will only see a distorted, weird painting.</p>
		<h1>Where did 3D painting come from?</h1>
		<img src="../Images/3Dpaint2.jpg" class="3dpaint2">
		<p>The origins of 3D painting date back to the 15th century. Perspective drawing was invented in Italy when artists got more and more used to giving their paintings an increasingly realistic twist. When painters wanted to make murals on walls and ceilings, they were confronted to the problem of distorsion. To make up for this issue they had to start using anamorphic tricks. One of the first examples of a study of anamorphosis is 'Leonardo's eye' by Leonardo Da Vinci.</p>
		<h1>When time does the class start?</h1>
		<p>The 3D painting class would be estimated that it would open in next 2 months due to the difficult of finding the paint instructor.But don't worry.We would find the well-trained teacher quickly and we would open the class in soon.</p>
